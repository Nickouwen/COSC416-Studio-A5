# COSC416-Studio-A5

Feature 1: Particle Effects
- Added particle effects to the ball when it collides with bricks, and separate coloured effects for collision with the paddle.

Feature 2: Sound Effects
- Added sfx for collision with walls, paddle, and bricks. Pitch increases for each subsequent brick before touching the paddle again to give a sense of a combo to the user.
